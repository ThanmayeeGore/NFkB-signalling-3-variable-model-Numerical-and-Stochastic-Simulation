# Numerical-and-Stochastic-Simulation of $NF \kappa B$ signalling system

This file implements the numerical and stochastic simulaion of 3 variable model of $NF \kappa B$ signalling system. The "OD_Solve.py" file is of numerical simualtion, "Gillespie_Algorithm.py" the stochastic simulation and "ConvexHull_Function.py" provides a function to plot the convex hull of the provided coordinates; here the coordinates are the amplitude and time period of the oscillations obtained by the Gillespie algorithm.
